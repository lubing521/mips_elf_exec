DESCRIPTION
This library provides routines to manage some partially-balanced binary trees
using the AVL algorithm. The tree nodes are ordered according to a given fully
ordered relation, and there cannot be two nodes in the tree that are considered
as equals by this relation. A balancing algorithm is run after each insertion
or deletion operation. The balancing algorithm is guaranteed to run in time
proportional to the height of the tree, and this height is guaranteed to only
grow with log(N) where N is the number of nodes in the tree. Thus searching,
insertion and deletion are all guaranteed to run in time proportional to
log(N).

Because the rebalancing operation might require re-rooting the binary tree,
the arguments to the insertion and deletion operations cannot be simply
pointers to the root node but they need to be pointers to the root node
pointer. This way the root node pointer can be modified when the binary tree
is re-rooted.

In order to save some memory, the tree nodes does not contains pointers to
their parent node. However, the rebalancing operation needs to walk from a
given node up to the root node. We thus expect the insertion and deletion
routines to keep track of the path they followed from the root down to the
leaf node they had to insert or delete. See the avlRebalance routine for more
details about this, and the avlInsert and avlDelete routines for reference
implementations.

It is an implementation goal to allow the creation of AVL trees containing
some various data types in their nodes. However, the searching, insertion,
and deletion routines needs to be able to compare two data nodes, so they
are dependant upon the precise type of the search keys. The implementation of
avlSearch, avlInsert and avlDelete uses a user-provided function that compares
a tree node with a value and returns -1, 0 or 1 depending if this value is
inferior, equal or superior to the key of the tree node. The value that is
passed to this comparison function is typed as a GENERIC_ARGUMENT, which is a
C union of an integer and a void pointer, thus making argument passing both
fast and generic.

INTERNAL
For cases where execution speed is more important than code size, one could
also use his own specialized routines instead of avlInsert, avlDelete and/or
avlSearch, where the comparison function would be hardcoded to suit the user's
needs. If one decides to do so, he can still use the generic avlRebalance
routine because thisone does not needs to use a comparison function.

/*******************************************************************************
*
* avlRebalance - make sure the tree conforms to the AVL balancing rules, while
* preserving the ordering of the binary tree
*
* INTERNAL
* The AVL tree balancing rules are as follows :
* - the height of the left and right subtrees under a given node must never
*   differ by more than one
* - the height of a given subtree is defined as 1 plus the maximum height of
*   the subtrees under his root node
*
* The avlRebalance procedure must be called after a leaf node has been inserted
* or deleted from the tree. It checks that the AVL balancing rules are
* respected, makes local adjustments to the tree if necessary, recalculates
* the height field of the modified nodes, and repeats the process for every
* node up to the root node. This iteration is necessary because the balancing
* rules for a given node might have been broken by the modification we did on
* one of the subtrees under it.
*
* Because we need to iterate the process up to the root node, and the tree
* nodes does not contain pointers to their father node, we ask the caller of
* this procedure to keep a list of all the nodes traversed from the root node
* to the node just before the recently inserted or deleted node. This is the
* <ancestors> argument. Because each subtree might have to be re-rooted in the
* balancing operation, <ancestors> is actually a list pointers to the node
* pointers - thus if re-rooting occurs, the node pointers can be modified so
* that they keep pointing to the root of a given subtree.
*
* <count> is simply a count of elements in the <ancestors> list.

* RETURNS: N/A

* avlDelete - delete a node in an AVL tree
*
* At the time of the call, <root> points to the root node pointer and
* <key> is the key of the node we want to delete. <compare> is the
* user-provided comparison function.
*
* The deletion operation will of course fail if the desired node was not
* already in the tree.
*
* Also note that because we keep the tree balanced, the root node pointer that
* is pointed by the <root> argument can be modified in this function.
*
* On exit, the node is removed from the AVL tree but it is not free()'d.
*
* INTERNAL
* The deletion routine works just like in a non-balanced binary tree : we
* walk down the tree like searching the node we have to delete. When we find
* it, if it is not a leaf node, we have to replace it with a leaf node that
* has an adjacent key. Then the rebalancing operation will have to enforce the
* balancing rules by walking up the path from the leaf node that got deleted
* or moved.
*
* Because the balancing procedure needs to be able to walk back to the root
* node, we keep a list of pointers to the pointers we followed on our way down
* the tree.
